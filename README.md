# JAVA | SPRINGBOOT | REACT
# I'm a Computer Science student and Web Developer.

I made a career transition at age 30, I have a degree in library science and a master's degree in education, but I'm passionate about technology and I'm curious about how to develop technological systems and that's why I changed careers.
I'm currently studying java programming, language paradigms and patterns.
